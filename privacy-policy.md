# Deadline Dynamo Privacy Policy
Last updated: 3/8/2024

At DeadlineDynamo, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect,
use, and protect the information you provide when using our Chrome extension.

## Information We Collect
DeadlineDynamo is a Chrome extension designed to help you plan and manage your assignments on the
BYU-Idaho Canvas platform. To provide this functionality, the extension collects and stores the
following information.

The extension retrieves and stores information about your courses, assignments, due dates, and
related details from the Canvas API. This data is necessary for the extension to function correctly.
The extension also stores user settings. The extension allows you to customize various settings,
such as work hours, estimate multipliers, and planning preferences. These settings are stored locally
on your device. Please note that Deadline Dynamo does not collect or store any personal information
that could directly identify you, such as your name, email address, or student ID.

## Use of Information
The information collected by Deadline Dynamo is used solely for the purpose of providing the
extension's functionality and enhancing your user experience. Specifically, the collected data
is used to:

1. Display your courses and assignments in the extension's planner interface.
2. Calculate estimated times for assignments based on your settings and preferences.
3. Facilitate drag-and-drop planning and scheduling of assignments.
4. Remember your settings and preferences across sessions.
5. We do not share or sell any of the collected information with third parties.

## Data Storage and Retention
All the data collected by DeadlineDynamo is stored locally on your device using the Chrome Storage API.
No data is transmitted or stored on remote servers. The data will be retained until you remove the
extension or clear your browsing data, including Chrome's local storage.

## Security
DeadlineDynamo takes reasonable measures to protect the information collected from unauthorized
access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please note that no method of data
transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for
other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We encourage you to periodically review this
Privacy Policy for the latest information on our privacy practices.
