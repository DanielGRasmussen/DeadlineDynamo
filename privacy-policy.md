# Deadline Dynamo Privacy Policy
Last updated: 4/2/2024

DeadlineDynamo takes your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect,
use, and protect the information you provide when using our Chrome extension.

## Information We Collect
DeadlineDynamo is a Chrome extension designed to help you plan and manage your assignments on the
BYU-Idaho Canvas platform. To provide this functionality, the extension collects and stores the
following information on:

1. Courses
2. Assignments
3. Assignment content
4. Assignment due date
5. Assignment availability
6. Assignment completion status
7. Assignment submission types
8. Event time/location

This data is necessary for the extension to function correctly.
The extension also stores user settings and states of items in our UI. The extension allows you to
customize various settings, such as work hours, estimate multipliers, and planning preferences. These
settings are stored on your device and Chrome's sync storage. Please note that Deadline Dynamo does
not collect or store any personal information that could directly identify you, such as your name,
email address, or student ID.

## Use of Information
The information collected by Deadline Dynamo is used solely for the purpose of providing the
extension's functionality and enhancing your user experience. Specifically, the collected data
is used to:

1. Display your courses and assignments in the extension's planner interface.
2. Calculate estimated times for assignments based on your settings and preferences.
3. Facilitate drag-and-drop planning and scheduling of assignments.
4. Remember your settings and states of items across sessions.
5. We do not share or sell any of the collected information with third parties.

## Data Storage and Retention
All the data collected by DeadlineDynamo is stored using Chrome's Sync Storage API, which
synchronizes data across your signed-in Chrome instances. No data is transmitted or stored on
remote servers controlled by us. The data will be retained until you remove the extension, clear your
browsing data, sign out of your Google Account, or switch to a different Google Account. Please note that Chrome's Sync Storage is tied
to your Google Account, and the data may be accessible on any device where you are signed in with
the same Google Account.

## Security
DeadlineDynamo takes reasonable measures to protect the information collected from unauthorized
access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please note that no method of data
transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. While the
extension doesn't transmit data to remote servers, the security of the data stored in Chrome's
Sync Storage is subject to Google's security practices and policies.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for
other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We encourage you to periodically review this
Privacy Policy for the latest information on our privacy practices.
